### Steps to Set Up a Live-Reload Server in Go

1. **Install `air` for Go**: `air` is a Go live-reload tool that watches for file changes and automatically reloads the server.

   * Install **`air`**:

     ```bash
     go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
     ```

   * After installation, make sure your `GOPATH` is set correctly. Typically, for `go install`, the binary will be placed in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, and it should be available in your `PATH`.

2. **Project Structure**: For simplicity, let's assume your project structure is as follows:

   ```
   my_project/
   ├── cmd/
   │   └── api/
   │       └── main.go
   ├── go.mod
   └── go.sum
   ```

3. **Set up the `main.go` file**: This is the entry point for your Go application (similar to `main.py` in FastAPI).

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
   )

   func main() {
       router := gin.Default()

       // Example endpoint
       router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
           c.JSON(200, gin.H{
               "message": "Hello, World!",
           })
       })

       // Run the server
       fmt.Println("Server is running at http://localhost:8080")
       if err := router.Run(":8080"); err != nil {
           fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Create `.air.toml` configuration**: `air` uses a configuration file `.air.toml` to set up auto-reloading rules.

   Create a file `.air.toml` in the root of your project:

   ```toml
   # .air.toml
   [build]
   cmd = "go build -o ./bin/main"
   bin = "./bin/main"
   include = ["**/*.go"]
   exclude = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor"]

   [log]
   time = true
   ```

   This configuration tells `air` to watch for changes in `.go` files and rebuild the server when necessary.

5. **Run the application with `air`**: Once everything is set up, you can run your server with live-reload using `air`:

   ```bash
   air
   ```

   Now, any changes you make to the Go files will automatically trigger a rebuild, and the server will reload, just like FastAPI's development server.

6. **Check the application**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the "Hello, World!" message. As you modify the Go code, the server will automatically reload.

### Benefits:

* **Auto-reloading**: The server automatically reloads when changes are detected in the Go files.
* **Fast Development**: Just like FastAPI, you can develop quickly without needing to manually restart the server.
* **Simple Setup**: This setup with `air` is easy to configure and use.

### Example Workflow:

1. Run the server using `air`:

   ```bash
   air
   ```

2. Change the `main.go` file to update the response or add new endpoints.

3. The server will automatically rebuild and reload without you needing to stop or restart it manually.

### Alternatives:

* **`gin` (Go Framework)**: If you're using the Gin framework, you can also use Gin's built-in recovery middleware and logging features to aid in development. But `air` is the simplest option to achieve live-reloading.

### Final Thoughts:

This setup in Go with `air` is the closest equivalent to the development environment that FastAPI or Uvicorn provides. It allows for efficient development with real-time feedback.
