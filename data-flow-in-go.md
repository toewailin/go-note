Understanding Go Project Layers and Data Flow
Structuring a Go project effectively is crucial for scalability and maintainability. While there's no single "correct" way, a common and highly effective pattern is a layered architecture. This approach separates your application into distinct, focused parts, making it easier to manage complexity, especially as the project grows.
Here's a breakdown of a recommended layered structure and how data flows through it:
Recommended Project Layers
A typical Go project, especially for a web service or API, can be organized into three to four main layers. A good starting point is a three-layer architecture:
 * Transport/HTTP Layer
 * Service/Business Logic Layer
 * Repository/Data Access Layer
Each layer has a specific responsibility and is designed to interact only with the layer directly below it.
1. Transport/HTTP Layer (The "Outer" Layer)
This is the entry point for your application. Its sole responsibility is to handle incoming requests and outgoing responses. It should be "dumb" and contain as little business logic as possible.
 * Responsibilities:
   * Receiving requests: Capturing HTTP requests (e.g., from a router like gorilla/mux or chi).
   * Input validation: Validating the format of the request data (e.g., ensuring a userID is an integer).
   * Deserialization: Converting JSON, XML, or other request body formats into Go structs.
   * Calling the Service Layer: Passing the validated data to the appropriate service.
   * Handling responses: Formatting the service's result into an HTTP response (e.g., JSON), setting the correct status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found), and handling errors.
 * Example File Structure: cmd/api/main.go, internal/handler/user_handler.go
2. Service/Business Logic Layer (The "Core" Layer)
This is the heart of your application. It contains all the business rules and logic. The service layer should be completely independent of the transport layer, meaning it should not know anything about HTTP, JSON, or any specific framework.
 * Responsibilities:
   * Executing business logic: Processing data, making decisions, and orchestrating tasks.
   * Calling the Repository Layer: Interacting with the repository to retrieve or persist data.
   * Enforcing business rules: For example, "A user cannot be created with a duplicate email address."
   * Handling business errors: Returning domain-specific errors (e.g., ErrUserNotFound).
 * Example File Structure: internal/service/user_service.go
3. Repository/Data Access Layer (The "Inner" Layer)
This layer is responsible for all interactions with data persistence, such as a database, a file system, or an external API. It should also be independent of the layers above it.
 * Responsibilities:
   * Translating Go structs to database models: Converting your application's data structures into a format the database can understand.
   * Executing queries: Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   * Handling data source errors: Converting low-level database errors into more generic, predictable errors for the service layer.
 * Example File Structure: internal/repository/user_repository.go
How Data Flows Through the Layers
Data flow is a one-way street, typically from the outside in (request) and then back out (response). This is a principle of dependency inversion: higher-level layers should not depend on lower-level ones directly, but on abstractions (interfaces).
The Request Flow (From Client to Database)
 * Client makes a request: A user sends an HTTP POST request to /users.
 * Transport Layer (user_handler.go):
   * Receives the HTTP request.
   * Parses the JSON body into a CreateUserRequest struct.
   * Performs basic validation (e.g., checks if the email field is empty).
   * Calls the service layer: userService.CreateUser(ctx, request.Email, request.Password).
 * Service Layer (user_service.go):
   * Receives the email and password.
   * Performs business logic (e.g., checks if the email already exists in the database by calling the repository).
   * Creates a User domain model.
   * Calls the repository layer to save the new user: userRepository.Create(ctx, newUser).
 * Repository Layer (user_repository.go):
   * Receives the User domain model.
   * Translates the User struct into a database-specific model (e.g., a GORM or SQL struct).
   * Executes the SQL INSERT statement to save the user to the database.
   * Returns the newly created user (with its ID) and any errors back to the service layer.
The Response Flow (From Database to Client)
 * Repository Layer: Returns the created User struct and nil (if successful) to the service layer.
 * Service Layer: Receives the new user, performs any final business logic, and returns the User struct and nil to the transport layer.
 * Transport Layer:
   * Receives the User struct.
   * Formats the User into a JSON response.
   * Sets the HTTP status code to 201 Created.
   * Writes the JSON response back to the client.
Using Interfaces for Decoupling
The key to this architecture is using interfaces to define the contract between layers. This is a fundamental concept in Go.
For example, your user_service.go should depend on a UserRepository interface, not a concrete PostgresUserRepository struct.
// internal/repository/user_repository.go

// UserRepository defines the contract for data access.
type UserRepository interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) (*User, error)
    GetByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (*User, error)
}

// internal/service/user_service.go

type UserService struct {
    repo UserRepository // Depends on the interface
}

func NewUserService(repo UserRepository) *UserService {
    return &UserService{repo: repo}
}

// ... service methods that use repo.Create() ...

This way, you could easily swap out your PostgreSQL implementation for a MongoDB or a mock repository for testing without changing the service layer's code. This is a powerful form of dependency injection that makes your code flexible and testable.
