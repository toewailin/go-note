### **Understanding Go Project Layers and Data Flow**

Structuring a Go project effectively is crucial for **scalability** and **maintainability**. While there's no single "correct" way, a common and highly effective pattern is a **layered architecture**. This approach separates your application into distinct, focused parts, making it easier to manage complexity, especially as the project grows.

Here's a breakdown of a recommended layered structure and how data flows through it:

---

### **Recommended Project Layers**

A typical Go project, especially for a **web service** or **API**, can be organized into three to four main layers. A good starting point is a **three-layer architecture**:

* **Transport/HTTP Layer**
* **Service/Business Logic Layer**
* **Repository/Data Access Layer**

Each layer has a specific responsibility and is designed to interact only with the layer directly below it.

---

### **1. Transport/HTTP Layer (The "Outer" Layer)**

This is the **entry point** for your application. Its sole responsibility is to handle incoming requests and outgoing responses. It should be "dumb" and contain as little business logic as possible.

#### **Responsibilities**:

* **Receiving requests**: Capturing HTTP requests (e.g., from a router like **gorilla/mux** or **chi**).
* **Input validation**: Validating the format of the request data (e.g., ensuring a `userID` is an integer).
* **Deserialization**: Converting JSON, XML, or other request body formats into Go structs.
* **Calling the Service Layer**: Passing the validated data to the appropriate service.
* **Handling responses**: Formatting the service's result into an HTTP response (e.g., JSON), setting the correct status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found), and handling errors.

#### **Example File Structure**:

* `cmd/api/main.go`
* `internal/handler/user_handler.go`

---

### **2. Service/Business Logic Layer (The "Core" Layer)**

This is the **heart** of your application. It contains all the **business rules** and **logic**. The service layer should be completely independent of the transport layer, meaning it should not know anything about HTTP, JSON, or any specific framework.

#### **Responsibilities**:

* **Executing business logic**: Processing data, making decisions, and orchestrating tasks.
* **Calling the Repository Layer**: Interacting with the repository to retrieve or persist data.
* **Enforcing business rules**: For example, "A user cannot be created with a duplicate email address."
* **Handling business errors**: Returning domain-specific errors (e.g., `ErrUserNotFound`).

#### **Example File Structure**:

* `internal/service/user_service.go`

---

### **3. Repository/Data Access Layer (The "Inner" Layer)**

This layer is responsible for all interactions with data persistence, such as a **database**, a **file system**, or an **external API**. It should also be independent of the layers above it.

#### **Responsibilities**:

* **Translating Go structs to database models**: Converting your application's data structures into a format the database can understand.
* **Executing queries**: Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* **Handling data source errors**: Converting low-level database errors into more generic, predictable errors for the service layer.

#### **Example File Structure**:

* `internal/repository/user_repository.go`

---

### **How Data Flows Through the Layers**

Data flow is a one-way street, typically from the outside in (request) and then back out (response). This is a principle of **dependency inversion**: higher-level layers should not depend on lower-level ones directly, but on **abstractions (interfaces)**.

---

#### **The Request Flow (From Client to Database)**:

1. **Client makes a request**: A user sends an HTTP **POST** request to `/users`.
2. **Transport Layer (`user_handler.go`)**:

   * Receives the HTTP request.
   * Parses the JSON body into a `CreateUserRequest` struct.
   * Performs basic validation (e.g., checks if the email field is empty).
   * Calls the service layer: `userService.CreateUser(ctx, request.Email, request.Password)`.
3. **Service Layer (`user_service.go`)**:

   * Receives the email and password.
   * Performs business logic (e.g., checks if the email already exists in the database by calling the repository).
   * Creates a `User` domain model.
   * Calls the repository layer to save the new user: `userRepository.Create(ctx, newUser)`.
4. **Repository Layer (`user_repository.go`)**:

   * Receives the `User` domain model.
   * Translates the `User` struct into a database-specific model (e.g., a GORM or SQL struct).
   * Executes the **SQL INSERT** statement to save the user to the database.
   * Returns the newly created user (with its ID) and any errors back to the service layer.

---

#### **The Response Flow (From Database to Client)**:

1. **Repository Layer**: Returns the created `User` struct and `nil` (if successful) to the service layer.
2. **Service Layer**: Receives the new user, performs any final business logic, and returns the `User` struct and `nil` to the transport layer.
3. **Transport Layer**:

   * Receives the `User` struct.
   * Formats the `User` into a JSON response.
   * Sets the HTTP status code to `201 Created`.
   * Writes the JSON response back to the client.

---

### **Using Interfaces for Decoupling**

The key to this architecture is using **interfaces** to define the contract between layers. This is a fundamental concept in Go.

For example, your `user_service.go` should depend on a **UserRepository interface**, not a concrete `PostgresUserRepository` struct.

#### **Example: Define Interface for Repository (`user_repository.go`)**:

```go
// internal/repository/user_repository.go

// UserRepository defines the contract for data access.
type UserRepository interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) (*User, error)
    GetByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (*User, error)
}
```

#### **Example: Implement the Service Layer Using the Interface (`user_service.go`)**:

```go
// internal/service/user_service.go

type UserService struct {
    repo UserRepository // Depends on the interface
}

// Constructor for UserService
func NewUserService(repo UserRepository) *UserService {
    return &UserService{repo: repo}
}

// Method to create a user
func (s *UserService) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, email string, password string) (*User, error) {
    // Perform some business logic here

    // Create the user
    user := &User{
        Email:    email,
        Password: password,
    }

    // Save the user using the repository
    createdUser, err := s.repo.Create(ctx, user)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return createdUser, nil
}
```

#### **Why Use Interfaces?**

* **Decoupling**: The service layer doesn't need to know about the specific **repository implementation** (e.g., Postgres, MongoDB, etc.). It only depends on the `UserRepository` interface.
* **Flexibility**: You can easily **swap out** the repository implementation (e.g., switching from a PostgreSQL database to MongoDB) without modifying the service layer.
* **Testability**: During testing, you can **mock** the repository layer by implementing the `UserRepository` interface and testing the service layer independently.

### **Summary of the Layers and Data Flow**:

1. **Transport/HTTP Layer**: Handles incoming requests and outgoing responses with minimal business logic.
2. **Service/Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core business logic and interacts with the repository layer for data operations.
3. **Repository/Data Access Layer**: Interacts directly with the data source (e.g., database) and manages CRUD operations.

**Data flow** starts with the **request** from the client, flows through the layers (transport -> service -> repository), and ends with a **response** sent back to the client.

Using **interfaces** for decoupling layers helps in making the architecture flexible, testable, and scalable.
