Detailed Architecture Design for Drone and Vessel Operations Management System with Real-Time Video Streaming

1. High-Level Overview

The system consists of several components to handle API operations, telemetry, real-time communication, and video streaming. Here’s the proposed architecture:
	1.	Frontend: A web-based dashboard for monitoring drones and vessels, managing operations, and viewing live video streams.
	2.	Backend: Built with Fiber, it handles:
	•	RESTful APIs for operations management.
	•	WebSocket for real-time telemetry and control.
	•	Integration with streaming protocols like WebRTC for video.
	3.	Streaming Server: Handles real-time video encoding, decoding, and distribution.
	4.	Database: Stores operational data such as drone/vessel logs, user data, and settings.
	5.	Message Broker: Manages communication between drones/vessels and the backend (e.g., MQTT, RabbitMQ, or Kafka).
	6.	Drone/Vessel Communication Module: Interfaces with hardware for telemetry, commands, and video streams.

2. Architecture Components

Frontend
	•	Tech Stack: React.js, Vue.js, or Angular for real-time updates.
	•	Features:
	•	Real-time map integration (Google Maps, Leaflet.js, or Mapbox).
	•	Live telemetry (speed, location, battery status).
	•	Video player for live streaming (WebRTC or HLS support).
	•	Control panel for sending commands.

Backend (Fiber Framework)
	•	Core Responsibilities:
	•	Handle RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
	•	Integrate with the streaming server for video distribution.
	•	Manage authentication and authorization.
	•	Key Features:
	•	API Endpoints:
	•	/drones (GET, POST, PUT): Manage drones (list, add, update).
	•	/vessels (GET, POST, PUT): Manage vessels.
	•	/telemetry (WebSocket): Real-time telemetry data.
	•	/control (POST via WebSocket): Send control commands.
	•	WebSocket:
	•	Handle real-time communication for telemetry and commands.
	•	Integrate with a message broker (e.g., MQTT).
	•	Video Streaming:
	•	Proxy WebRTC or HLS streams to the frontend.

Streaming Server
	•	Purpose:
	•	Handle live video streams from drones and vessels.
	•	Encode and transcode video streams.
	•	Tools:
	•	FFmpeg: Encode/convert video streams for WebRTC or HLS.
	•	WebRTC: Low-latency streaming for live video.
	•	GStreamer: Alternative for video streaming pipelines.

Message Broker
	•	Purpose:
	•	Manage communication between drones/vessels and the backend.
	•	Ensure reliable telemetry and command delivery.
	•	Options:
	•	MQTT: Lightweight for IoT (drones/vessels telemetry).
	•	Kafka: High throughput for larger systems.
	•	RabbitMQ: Reliable message delivery with routing capabilities.

Database
	•	Purpose:
	•	Store operational data and logs.
	•	Recommended Database:
	•	PostgreSQL: Relational data (operations, users, logs).
	•	MongoDB: Telemetry data (real-time, unstructured data).
	•	Redis: Cache for low-latency access to live telemetry.

3. Architectural Diagram

Here’s how the components fit together:

[Frontend (React, Vue)] <--> [Fiber Backend (REST, WebSocket)]
                                       |
        -------------------------------------------------------
        |                     |                        |
  [Streaming Server]   [Message Broker]       [Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)]
        |                     |
[Drone/Vessel Video]     [Telemetry & Control Commands]

4. Technology Stack

Component	Technology	Purpose
Frontend	React.js/Vue.js	Build the user dashboard for real-time telemetry and video streaming.
Backend Framework	Fiber	Handle API routing, WebSocket communication, and backend logic.
Streaming Server	FFmpeg + WebRTC	Encode and stream real-time video.
Message Broker	MQTT/RabbitMQ/Kafka	Manage telemetry and command communication.
Database	PostgreSQL + Redis (cache)	Store operational data and provide fast access to live telemetry.
Maps Integration	Mapbox/Leaflet.js	Real-time visualization of drones/vessels on the map.
Video Player	WebRTC or HLS.js	Display live video streams on the frontend.

5. Real-Time Video Streaming Pipeline
	1.	Drone/Vessel Camera:
	•	Capture raw video footage.
	2.	Streaming Server:
	•	Use FFmpeg or GStreamer to encode the video into WebRTC-compatible format.
	3.	Backend (Fiber):
	•	Proxy WebRTC streams to the frontend for live viewing.
	4.	Frontend:
	•	Use a WebRTC-enabled player to display the video.

6. Example: Fiber WebSocket Code

package main

import (
    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    "github.com/gofiber/websocket/v2"
)

func main() {
    app := fiber.New()

    // WebSocket endpoint for real-time telemetry
    app.Get("/telemetry", websocket.New(func(c *websocket.Conn) {
        for {
            // Read telemetry data from drone/vessel
            messageType, msg, err := c.ReadMessage()
            if err != nil {
                return
            }

            // Log or process telemetry
            println("Received:", string(msg))

            // Send response or acknowledgment
            if err := c.WriteMessage(messageType, []byte("Acknowledged")); err != nil {
                return
            }
        }
    }))

    app.Listen(":8080")
}

7. Deployment Considerations
	•	Containerization: Use Docker to package the backend, streaming server, and message broker for consistent deployment.
	•	Load Balancing: Use tools like NGINX or HAProxy to handle high traffic.
	•	Scaling: Use Kubernetes to scale services dynamically based on demand.
