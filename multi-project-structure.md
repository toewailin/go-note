### **Why Use a Single `go.mod` File for Your Monorepo-Style Setup**

Using a **single `go.mod` file** at the root of the repository is the best approach when you have multiple projects that share common code. Here are the key reasons why:

---

#### **1. Shared Code Between Projects**

Since **Project 1** and **Project 2** are likely to share common code (e.g., utility functions, models, database logic), having a single `go.mod` at the root makes managing shared dependencies easier.

For example, you can store common packages like `myutil` or `model` in the `pkg/` and `internal/` directories, and both projects can import them without worrying about managing separate `go.mod` files.

---

#### **2. Simplified Dependency Management**

A single `go.mod` file allows you to manage all dependencies for **Project 1** and **Project 2** in one place. Any shared dependencies will only appear once, avoiding duplication.

You can add or update dependencies centrally, ensuring both projects stay in sync with the required versions of packages.

---

#### **3. Consistency Across Projects**

With a single Go module, you ensure consistent versions of dependencies across both projects. This eliminates the need to manually synchronize dependencies between multiple `go.mod` files, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.

---

#### **4. Easier Build and CI/CD Setup**

With one `go.mod` file, you only need to build the entire project once, rather than separately building **Project 1** and **Project 2**. This simplifies build scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

If you set up a CI/CD pipeline, having one `go.mod` file simplifies integration and delivery processes.

---

#### **5. Project Evolution**

If **Project 1** and **Project 2** evolve together (e.g., part of the same larger system or a microservices architecture), using a single `go.mod` file simplifies maintaining both projects. This approach is ideal if both projects need to share logic, update simultaneously, or are closely coupled in terms of functionality.

---

### **How It Works for Your Provided Structure**

Here’s the structure with **single `go.mod`** applied, making both projects share code easily while keeping dependencies manageable:

```
myapp/
├── cmd/
│   ├── project1/           // Entry point for Project 1
│   └── project2/           // Entry point for Project 2
├── internal/
│   ├── project1/           // Logic for Project 1
│   │   ├── handler/        // API handlers for Project 1
│   │   ├── service/        // Business logic for Project 1
│   │   └── repository/     // Database access layer for Project 1
│   └── project2/           // Logic for Project 2
│       ├── handler/        // API handlers for Project 2
│       ├── service/        // Business logic for Project 2
│       └── repository/     // Database access layer for Project 2
│   ├── middleware/         // Common middleware (logging, auth, etc.)
│   └── model/              // Shared data models for both projects
├── pkg/
│   └── myutil/             // Shared utility functions (e.g., logging, helpers)
├── config/                 // Configuration for different projects
├── logger/                 // Centralized logging
├── docs/                   // API documentation (Swagger, OpenAPI)
├── tests/                  // Unit and integration tests
├── ci/                     // CI/CD pipeline configurations
├── .github/                // GitHub Actions configurations
├── go.mod                  // Root Go module definition
└── .golangci.yml           // Linter configuration
```

### **Project Structure Explanation**

1. **`cmd/`**:

   * Contains entry points for **Project 1** and **Project 2**. Each project has its own folder (`cmd/project1/` and `cmd/project2/`), which includes the `main.go` files that will start the respective application.

2. **`internal/`**:

   * Contains the business logic for both projects. This directory includes:

     * **`project1/`** and **`project2/`** directories for each project's specific logic (handlers, services, repositories).
     * **`middleware/`**: Shared middleware like authentication or logging.
     * **`model/`**: Shared data models used by both projects (e.g., `User`, `Product`).

3. **`pkg/`**:

   * Shared utility functions (e.g., logging, helpers) used across both projects.

4. **`config/`**:

   * Configuration files for the entire project, including environment variables and database settings.

5. **`logger/`**:

   * Centralized logging for both projects to maintain consistent logging across the entire application.

6. **`go.mod`**:

   * The root `go.mod` file manages dependencies for both **Project 1** and **Project 2**.

7. **`.golangci.yml`**:

   * Linter configuration to ensure consistent code quality across the monorepo.

### **How Go Handles Dependencies in a Single `go.mod` File**

When using a single `go.mod` file for both projects, **Go** handles dependencies centrally, ensuring each project only includes the dependencies it explicitly imports. Here's how it works:

1. **Shared Dependencies**:

   * Dependencies that are used by both projects (e.g., `gin`, `sqlx`) will only be listed once in the `go.mod` file.
2. **Project-Specific Dependencies**:

   * If **Project 1** uses a dependency (e.g., `sqlx`) and **Project 2** uses a different one (e.g., `mongodb-driver`), Go will include only the dependencies actually used by the respective projects in their builds.

---

### **Build Instructions for Each Project**

#### **1. Build Project 1**

To build **Project 1**, navigate to `cmd/project1/` and run the following:

1. **Navigate to the Project 1 directory**:

   ```sh
   cd cmd/project1
   ```

2. **Build the Project 1 executable**:

   ```sh
   go build -o project1-executable
   ```

3. **Run Project 1**:

   ```sh
   ./project1-executable
   ```

#### **2. Build Project 2**

Similarly, to build **Project 2**, navigate to `cmd/project2/` and run:

1. **Navigate to the Project 2 directory**:

   ```sh
   cd cmd/project2
   ```

2. **Build the Project 2 executable**:

   ```sh
   go build -o project2-executable
   ```

3. **Run Project 2**:

   ```sh
   ./project2-executable
   ```

#### **3. Build Both Projects Together**

To build both projects together, you can create a simple **`build.sh`** script to automate the build process:

1. **Create `build.sh`** at the root:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Build Project 1
cd cmd/project1
echo "Building Project 1..."
go build -o project1-executable

# Build Project 2
cd ../project2
echo "Building Project 2..."
go build -o project2-executable

echo "Both projects built successfully!"
```

2. **Make the script executable**:

   ```sh
   chmod +x build.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

---

### **Managing Dependencies Efficiently**

With a single `go.mod` file, Go will automatically resolve dependencies and ensure that only the **used dependencies** are included in the build.

1. **Shared dependencies** will be included once, even if both projects use them.
2. **Unused dependencies** will not be included in the build of each project, avoiding bloat.

To clean up unused dependencies, run:

```sh
go mod tidy
```

---

### **CI/CD and Automation**

To integrate **CI/CD** with this structure, you can use the following:

1. **CI/CD for Project 1 and Project 2**:

   * You can use a single workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build both projects together or separately.

2. **Example GitHub Actions Workflow**:

```yaml
name: Build Projects

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: '1.18'

      - name: Build Project 1
        run: |
          cd cmd/project1
          go build -o project1-executable

      - name: Build Project 2
        run: |
          cd cmd/project2
          go build -o project2-executable

      - name: Run tests
        run: go test ./...
```

---

### **Summary**

* **Single `go.mod` file**: Centralizes dependency management for both **Project 1** and **Project 2**.
* **Shared and independent dependencies** are handled efficiently, ensuring only the required dependencies are included in each project’s build.
* **Build projects** individually or together using simple commands or automation scripts.
* **CI/CD**: A single pipeline can handle building and testing both projects, streamlining integration and delivery.
