### **1. Single Project, Single Repository (Monolithic)**

This is the most basic structure where you have **one project** in a **single repository**. This approach is typically used for smaller applications or when the project doesn’t need to evolve into multiple modules.

#### **Example Structure**:

```
myapp/
├── cmd/                        // Entry point for the application
│   └── main.go                 // Main file for the application
├── internal/                   // Core business logic of the app
│   ├── handler/                // API handlers
│   ├── service/                // Business logic
│   └── repository/             // Database access layer
├── pkg/                        // Utility and helper functions
│   └── myutil/                 // Shared utility functions
├── go.mod                      // Go module definition
├── go.sum                      // Go checksum file
└── .golangci.yml               // Linter configuration
```

#### **Explanation**:

* **`cmd/`**: Contains the entry point (`main.go`) for the application.
* **`internal/`**: Contains core business logic. This is where all the handlers, services, and repositories reside.
* **`pkg/`**: Contains utility functions that can be shared across the application.
* **`go.mod`**: Manages dependencies for the single project.
* **`go.sum`**: Contains checksums for the dependencies.
* **`.golangci.yml`**: Configuration file for Go linters (e.g., `golangci-lint`).

#### **When to Use**:

* Small applications that don’t require modularity or separation into multiple services.
* Projects where all logic is self-contained and doesn’t need to evolve into multiple services or modules.

#### **Pros**:

* Simple setup.
* Easy to manage and build for small projects.

#### **Cons**:

* As the project grows, managing dependencies, versions, and modules can become complex.

### **2. Multiple Projects in a Single Repository (Monorepo)**

In a **monorepo** setup, you have multiple related projects (services, applications, or components) in the same repository. They share common code but can be developed independently.

#### **Example Structure**:

```
myapp/
├── cmd/                        // Entry points for both projects
│   ├── project1/               // Entry point for Project 1
│   │   └── main.go             // Main file to run Project 1
│   └── project2/               // Entry point for Project 2
│       └── main.go             // Main file to run Project 2
├── internal/                   // Core business logic for both projects
│   ├── project1/               // Project 1 logic
│   │   ├── handler/            // API handlers for Project 1
│   │   ├── service/            // Business logic for Project 1
│   │   └── repository/         // Database access layer for Project 1
│   └── project2/               // Project 2 logic
│       ├── handler/            // API handlers for Project 2
│       ├── service/            // Business logic for Project 2
│       └── repository/         // Database access layer for Project 2
│   ├── middleware/             // Common middleware (logging, auth, etc.)
│   └── model/                  // Shared models (e.g., User, Product)
├── pkg/                        // Shared utility functions
│   └── myutil/                 // Utility functions shared across both projects
├── go.mod                      // Root Go module definition
├── go.sum                      // Go checksum file
├── .golangci.yml               // Linter configuration
└── docs/                       // Documentation (Swagger, OpenAPI)
```

#### **Explanation**:

* **`cmd/`**: Contains the entry points (`main.go`) for **Project 1** and **Project 2**.
* **`internal/`**: Core logic for both projects, separated into different directories for each project. Common middleware and shared models (e.g., `User`, `Product`) are stored here.
* **`pkg/`**: Shared utility functions, such as logging, helpers, or other utilities used across both projects.
* **`go.mod`**: Manages dependencies for the entire monorepo.
* **`go.sum`**: Contains checksums for the dependencies.
* **`.golangci.yml`**: Configuration for Go linters.
* **`docs/`**: API documentation (e.g., Swagger) for both projects.

#### **When to Use**:

* When you have multiple projects or services that share common code.
* When different teams or individuals work on related components or services that are tightly coupled.
* In a **microservices architecture** where services evolve together.

#### **Pros**:

* **Shared code**: Easy sharing of common code across projects.
* **Centralized dependency management**: All dependencies are handled by a single `go.mod` file.
* **Unified CI/CD pipeline**: Easier to manage build, test, and deployment pipelines for all projects.
* **Faster collaboration**: Teams working on different projects can collaborate more effectively within the same repository.

#### **Cons**:

* Can become **complex** as more projects are added.
* **Build times** may increase as the repo grows.
* **Git history** can get complicated with multiple projects and contributors.

### **3. Multiple Projects, Multiple Repositories (Polyrepo)**

In a **polyrepo** structure, each project has its **own repository**, and there is no central repository managing all projects. This approach is more modular and decouples each project into its own repository.

#### **Example Structure**:

```
project1-repo/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go               // Main file for Project 1
├── internal/
│   ├── handler/              // API handlers for Project 1
│   ├── service/              // Business logic for Project 1
│   └── repository/           // Database access layer for Project 1
├── pkg/                      // Utility functions for Project 1
├── go.mod                    // Project 1's Go module definition

project2-repo/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go               // Main file for Project 2
├── internal/
│   ├── handler/              // API handlers for Project 2
│   ├── service/              // Business logic for Project 2
│   └── repository/           // Database access layer for Project 2
├── pkg/                      // Utility functions for Project 2
├── go.mod                    // Project 2's Go module definition
```

#### **Explanation**:

* **`cmd/`**: Each project has its own `cmd/` directory with the entry point (`main.go`).
* **`internal/`**: Core logic for each project is kept separate within its own repository.
* **`pkg/`**: Each project has its own set of utility functions.
* **`go.mod`**: Each project has its own `go.mod` file that handles its dependencies individually.

#### **When to Use**:

* When projects are completely **independent** and evolve separately.
* For larger teams working on different projects where ownership and versioning are separated.
* When each project has its own release cycle and needs isolated development.

#### **Pros**:

* **Separation of concerns**: Each project evolves independently with its own versioning.
* **Clear boundaries**: Projects are isolated in separate repositories.
* **Customization**: Each project can have its own build system, versioning, and CI/CD pipeline.

#### **Cons**:

* **Dependency management**: Shared dependencies must be manually synced across multiple repositories.
* **Cross-repository changes**: Coordinating changes between projects can become challenging.
* **Increased setup**: Setting up and maintaining multiple repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and versioning can become complex.

---

### **4. Multiple Projects in a Monorepo with Git Submodules**

This structure is similar to a **monorepo**, but uses **Git submodules** to manage each project as a separate repository under a parent repository.

#### **Example Structure**:

```
myapp/
├── project1/ (Git submodule)
├── project2/ (Git submodule)
├── go.mod
└── .golangci.yml
```

#### **When to Use**:

* When you want the flexibility of **multiple repositories** but prefer to manage them under one parent repository.
* When you want to include **external projects** as submodules and still maintain control over the parent repository.

#### **Pros**:

* **Separate versioning** for each project, but still under one parent repository.
* **Easier to manage submodules** when integrating other external projects.

#### **Cons**:

* **Complexity** of managing submodules, including updating and handling the nested repositories.
* Git workflows can become tricky, and developers may face merge conflicts with submodules.

---

### **5. Service-Oriented Architecture (Microservices)**

In a **microservices** approach, each service resides in its own repository and can be independently developed, tested, deployed, and scaled. Each service typically has its own **go.mod** file.

#### **Example Structure**:

```
auth-service-repo/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go               // Main entry point for auth service
├── internal/
│   ├── handler/              // API handlers for auth service
│   ├── service/              // Business logic for auth service
│   └── repository/           // Database access for auth service
├── go.mod                    // auth-service's Go module definition

payment-service-repo/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go               // Main entry point for payment service
├── internal/
│   ├── handler/              // API handlers for payment service
│   ├── service/              // Business logic for payment service
│   └── repository/           // Database access for payment service
├── go.mod                    // payment-service's Go module definition
```

#### **When to Use**:

* When the system is large, and each service is independent with its own lifecycle.
* For teams working on different components that need to scale or evolve independently.

#### **Pros**:

* **Independent services** with their own versioning, testing, and deployment cycles.
* **Scalable**: Each service can scale independently.

#### **Cons**:

* **Distributed management**: Requires managing multiple repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
* **Integration complexity**: Services must interact via APIs, adding complexity to communication between them.

---

### **Summary of Repository Types**

* **Single Project, Single Repository**: Best for small projects, with simple dependency management and a single codebase.
* **Multiple Projects in a Single Repository (Monorepo)**: Ideal for related projects that share code and evolve together, with centralized dependency management and unified CI/CD pipelines.
* **Multiple Projects, Multiple Repositories (Polyrepo)**: Suited for fully independent projects, with separate versioning and lifecycle management.
* **Monorepo with Git Submodules**: Good for managing multiple repositories within a single parent, but more complex than a pure monorepo.
* **Microservices**: Best for large-scale systems with independent services that scale and evolve separately.
