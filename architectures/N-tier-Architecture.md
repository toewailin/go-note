### Explanation of Each Folder:

* **cmd**: Contains the main entry point of the application (`main.go`).

* **config**: Holds configuration files (e.g., database settings, environment variables).

* **go.mod and go.sum**: Dependency management files.

* **handlers**: This folder contains HTTP request handlers for each module (FAQ, Product, Order, User). Handlers are responsible for processing incoming requests and responding with appropriate data.

* **models**: Defines the data structure (models) for each domain, like `Product`, `Order`, `FAQ`, and `User`. These models are typically used for mapping data from the database.

* **repository**: Contains methods to access data from the database. Repositories abstract the data access logic, making it easier to interact with databases.

* **routes**: Defines the HTTP routes for each domain, linking them to their respective handlers. It ensures that requests are properly routed to the correct handler.

* **services**: Contains the business logic for each domain. This layer interacts with the repository and processes data before returning it to the handlers.

* **utils**: Contains utility functions that are used throughout the application (e.g., helper functions for formatting responses).

This structure allows you to maintain clean separation between each component of the application, making it scalable and easy to extend. As your application grows, you can add more modules or features by simply following this structure.
