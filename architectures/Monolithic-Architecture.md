### Key Characteristics of **Monolithic Architecture**:

* **Single Codebase**: All the features, logic, and modules are contained in one codebase. This includes all the models, handlers, services, repositories, and routes.

* **Simplicity**: The structure is relatively straightforward. There's no need to handle inter-service communication like in microservices; everything is contained within one application.

* **Less Complex for Smaller Projects**: Monolithic architecture works well for small to medium-sized applications because everything is in one place. It's easier to develop, deploy, and manage for projects that don’t require horizontal scaling.

### Folder Structure Breakdown:

1. **cmd/main.go**:
   The main entry point of the application. It is responsible for initializing the application, setting up routes, starting the server, and configuring the application.

2. **config/config.go**:
   This file will contain the configuration details such as database connections, environment-specific settings, API keys, etc.

3. **go.mod and go.sum**:
   Dependency management files that ensure the project is using the correct Go modules and versions.

4. **handlers**:
   This folder contains the HTTP request handlers for each domain (FAQ, Product, Order, User). These handlers receive HTTP requests, interact with the services, and return HTTP responses.

   * `faq_handler.go`, `product_handler.go`, etc. handle the actual HTTP logic for processing requests and calling the services for business logic.

5. **models**:
   Contains the Go structs (models) representing your data objects. For example, `faq.go`, `product.go`, `order.go`, and `user.go` define the structure of data for each domain.

6. **repositories**:
   This folder abstracts the data access layer for each module (e.g., FAQ, Product, Order, User). The repositories directly interact with the database, performing CRUD operations.

7. **routes**:
   Defines the routing for the application. Each domain (FAQ, Product, Order, User) has its own routing file that maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to handlers.

8. **services**:
   Contains the business logic of the application. Services interact with repositories, processing and transforming the data before sending it back to the handlers. Each domain (FAQ, Product, Order, User) has a corresponding service file.

9. **utils**:
   This folder contains utility functions that can be reused across the application. For example, `response.go` could help with formatting HTTP responses or handling errors.

### When to Use **Monolithic Architecture**:

Monolithic architecture is well-suited for applications that:

* Have **limited scope** or **smaller scale**.
* Don’t need **complex domain separation** or inter-service communication.
* Can benefit from a **single codebase** for easier development and deployment.
* Have **simple business logic** or are still in the early stages of development.

### Pros of **Monolithic Architecture**:

* **Easier to develop and deploy**: Everything is in one place, making it simple to manage during development.
* **Faster to set up**: There is less overhead in managing multiple services or layers.
* **Lower operational complexity**: No need to manage inter-service communication or orchestration.

### Cons of **Monolithic Architecture**:

* **Scalability limitations**: As the application grows, it can become harder to scale since everything is bundled together.
* **Difficulty with large teams**: Managing a large codebase in a single monolithic repository can become unwieldy as teams grow.
* **Tight coupling**: Components are tightly coupled, meaning changes in one part of the application may affect other parts of the system.
