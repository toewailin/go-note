Great question! You're correct to consider the size and management of the go.mod file, especially as the project grows. Let's clarify what happens when you have a single go.mod file for multiple projects and how dependencies are handled.

How Go Handles Dependencies in a Single go.mod File

When you have multiple projects within the same Go module, Go will manage the dependencies centrally in the go.mod file at the root of your project. However, each project will only use the dependencies it explicitly imports. This means:

1. Project 1 will only use its own dependencies (those explicitly imported in its code), even if Project 2 has additional dependencies listed in the go.mod file.


2. Go will not automatically include all of Project 2's dependencies into Project 1’s build unless Project 1 imports and uses them.


3. If Project 1 doesn’t use any code from Project 2, it won’t include Project 2's dependencies in the build.



Does Project 1's Build Include Project 2's Dependencies?

No, Project 1's build does not automatically include Project 2's dependencies unless:

Project 1 imports some code or packages from Project 2.

Project 1 explicitly depends on the packages or modules used in Project 2.


How Go Handles This:

1. Shared Dependencies: If both Project 1 and Project 2 use the same dependency (e.g., gin or sqlx), Go will only include it once in the go.mod file. This helps avoid duplication. Go resolves the version for shared dependencies across the whole module.


2. Independent Dependencies: If Project 1 uses a different set of dependencies than Project 2, Go will include only those dependencies actually used by Project 1 in its build.



Example with Shared and Project-Specific Dependencies

Let’s assume the following:

Project 1 uses gin and sqlx.

Project 2 uses gin and mongodb-driver.


Your go.mod file will look something like this:

module myapp

go 1.18

require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.7.4
    github.com/jmoiron/sqlx v1.3.0
    go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver v1.7.0
)

Even though Project 2 is using mongodb-driver, Project 1 will not include MongoDB dependencies unless it explicitly imports MongoDB-related code. Go only includes the dependencies that are directly used by the project in question.

What Happens When You Build Project 1?

If Project 1 doesn't use any of Project 2's dependencies, only the dependencies used by Project 1 will be included in the build.

Project 2's dependencies will not be included in the binary for Project 1.


Build Example for Project 1:

When you run go build for Project 1:

cd myapp/cmd/project1
go build -o project1-executable

Only Project 1's dependencies (such as gin and sqlx) will be compiled, and Project 2's dependencies (such as mongodb-driver) won’t be included because Project 1 doesn't use them.

When Will Project 2's Dependencies Be Included?

Project 2's dependencies will be included in the build if Project 1 imports code from Project 2.

For example, if Project 1 imports a package from Project 2 (e.g., using myapp/internal/project2/):

// cmd/project1/main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "myapp/internal/project2/handler_new" // Importing something from Project 2
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Project 1 uses Project 2's code!")
    handler_new.GetProductHandler()  // Project 1 calling Project 2's handler
}

In this case, when you run go build for Project 1, Project 2's dependencies (like mongodb-driver) will also be included in the build, because Project 1 is using Project 2's code.

When Does go.mod Become Large?

The go.mod file might become large if:

1. You have a lot of dependencies across both projects (even if they are shared, the list will grow).


2. You include multiple dependencies that are not strictly needed by the project you're building.


3. You use a lot of third-party packages that are not cleaned up properly.



However, Go automatically handles dependency resolution, and only the used dependencies will be compiled into the binary.

How to Ensure Efficient Dependency Management:

1. Run go mod tidy: This will clean up the go.mod file by removing unused dependencies.

go mod tidy


2. Use build tags: If you only want to include certain dependencies in specific projects, you can use Go build tags to include/exclude code during compilation.

Summary

Project 1 will not include Project 2's dependencies unless it directly imports and uses code from Project 2.

A single go.mod file is fine because Go will only include the dependencies that are actively used by the specific project being built.

Shared dependencies will be included only once and managed efficiently by Go’s dependency resolution system.

If Project 1 and Project 2 do not share any code directly, there will be no unnecessary dependency bloat in the build of Project 1.

Use go mod tidy to keep your go.mod file clean and free of unused dependencies.
