### **Explanation of the Structure:**

1. **`cmd/`**: 
   - Contains the main entry points for the app.
   - **`api/`**: This folder contains the entry point for your API server (i.e., the main Go application that runs the API). This folder houses the main logic for handling HTTP requests and routing.
   - **`worker/`**: For background workers, cron jobs, or any processes that run asynchronously (outside of the HTTP request/response cycle).
   - **`cli/`**: For any command-line tools, such as migration scripts, seeding tools, or configuration setup.

2. **`config/`**:
   - Contains the application’s configuration files, such as `.env` files, configuration for external services, or environment-specific settings.
   - **`config.go`** loads and manages the configuration based on environment variables or a configuration file.

3. **`dto/`**:
   - Contains **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** used to define the request and response structures for your APIs. You can define DTOs for both admin and mobile API use cases here (e.g., user DTOs, authentication DTOs).
   - You can define shared DTOs (e.g., `user_dto.go`) that will be used across multiple endpoints to avoid duplication.

4. **`handler/`**:
   - Contains your **HTTP handlers (controllers)**, which are responsible for processing requests and returning responses.
   - A single `user_handler.go` can handle both Admin and Mobile user-related API endpoints, making the code modular and easy to maintain.

5. **`middleware/`**:
   - Contains middlewares for common tasks like authentication, logging, or error handling.
   - **`auth_middleware.go`** handles the token verification for protected routes.

6. **`model/`**:
   - Contains your **database models**, which represent your data structures.
   - The `user.go` model could represent both the Admin and Mobile user schemas, reducing duplication.

7. **`repository/`**:
   - Contains the **data access layer** where you define all interactions with the database. This will use the models defined in the `model/` folder to interact with the database.

8. **`service/`**:
   - Contains **business logic** and any computations or operations on data before interacting with the repository layer.
   - **`user_service.go`** could contain logic for user management like creating, updating, and deleting users for both admin and mobile users.

9. **`utils/`**:
   - Contains helper functions or utilities, such as handling JSON responses, generating JWT tokens, etc.
   - **`response.go`** and **`token.go`** are examples of utility functions that simplify your logic throughout the app.

10. **`test/`**:
    - Contains tests for unit, integration, and functional testing of the application’s components.

11. **`scripts/`**:
    - Contains deployment or DB migration scripts.

### **Why This Structure?**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each part of the application (authentication, user management, etc.) is modular and clearly separated. This makes the app scalable and easier to maintain.
- **Reusability**: Common DTOs, services, models, and handlers are shared for both the Admin and Mobile API endpoints, reducing duplication and keeping things DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- **Scalability**: With clearly defined layers (handlers, services, repositories), adding new features or endpoints is straightforward. You can extend the `handler/`, `service/`, and `repository/` layers as needed.
- **Clean Structure**: By keeping utility code (`utils/`), business logic (`service/`), and data access (`repository/`) separate from HTTP-specific logic (`handler/`), the project remains clean, organized, and easy to test.

This structure strikes a balance between organization, scalability, and simplicity, making it suitable for a large-scale Go backend API project with both admin and client-side endpoints.
